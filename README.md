# GPA Calculator Program

This is a simple Java program designed as part of the Software Engineering and Networks program at the Universidad del Valle de MÃ©xico (UVM). ðŸŽ“

## Overview

The program calculates a student's Grade Point Average (GPA) based on three input grades. It then evaluates the GPA and determines the student's status:

- **APPROVED**: If the GPA is 7 or higher ðŸŽ‰
- **REGULAR**: If the GPA is between 4 and 7 ðŸ“˜
- **FAILED**: If the GPA is below 4 ðŸ˜ž

The program uses `JOptionPane` for user input and output and `DecimalFormat` to format the GPA to two decimal places. This exercise helps practice basic Java programming and conditional logic. ðŸ’»
